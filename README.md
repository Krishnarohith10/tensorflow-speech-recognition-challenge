Download the dataset from http://download.tensorflow.org/data/speech_commands_v0.01.tar.gz  

This is Kaggle Competition by Google Brain. In this competition, you're challenged to use the Speech Commands Dataset to build an algorithm that understands simple spoken commands. By improving the recognition accuracy of open-sourced voice interface tools, we can improve product effectiveness and their accessibility.  

The core words are "Yes", "No", "Up", "Down", "Left", "Right", "On", "Off", "Stop", "Go", "Zero", "One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", and "Nine". To help distinguish unrecognized words, there are also ten auxiliary words, which most speakers only said once. These include "Bed", "Bird", "Cat", "Dog", "Happy", "House", "Marvin", "Sheila", "Tree", and "Wow".  

I used Convolution Neural Network instead of using Recurrent Neural Network. I am working on something else. If I get time, I will upload it by using Recurrent Neural Network like LSTM/GRU, Bidirectional.
